Hello. To use the speechChecker for Zoom. I had a problem. Can't make my own busineses on the lessons, which are in online now. 
With that program u will see, when peoples asking for you. Of course,u will hear anything, that they say. But u can stand your old laptop, open that and make your own business.
U will see, if peoples ask for u
#sequence of terms to use my program:
              LINUX TOPIC:
I love linux, i'm using linux, so.. If u like that too,than all be ok. 
1) We need  import threading
            import time
            import os
            import wave
            import tkinter
  I hadn't problems with installing that libraries.
 2) PyAudio - u need to install
   portaudio19-dev
 3) SpeechRecognition - i don't remember, but u probably may have some throubles with that. In my history nothing about it, so 
 i'm lucky.
 SO 3 comands:
 pip3 install SpeechRecognition time wave tkinter  portaudio19-dev
 sudo apt-get update
 pip3 install PyAudio
 AND PLEASE !!!ATTENTION!!! clone that file into "/" directory
 (If u in "/Downloads" write into console: mv speech.py ../), then you can write cd  , then python3 speech.py.
 I don't have enought time to understand, why that is not working in others places.
